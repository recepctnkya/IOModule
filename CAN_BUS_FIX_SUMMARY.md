# CAN Bus Communication Fix Summary

## Problem Analysis
Your CAN bus communication was stopping after a while due to several critical issues:

### Root Causes Identified:
1. **Missing Error Recovery Mechanisms** - No automatic recovery from Bus-Off errors
2. **Inadequate Error Handling** - Errors were only logged but not acted upon
3. **Task Blocking Issues** - `twai_read_alerts()` could block indefinitely
4. **Resource Management Issues** - No cleanup of failed transmissions or queue overflow handling

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. **Error Recovery System**
- Added `check_and_recover_from_errors()` function that:
  - Detects Bus-Off conditions and automatically restarts the driver
  - Monitors error counters and initiates recovery when thresholds are exceeded
  - Handles Error Passive state transitions

### 2. **Watchdog Monitoring**
- Added `can_watchdog_task()` that:
  - Monitors CAN bus health every 5 seconds
  - Logs detailed status information (state, error counters, recovery count)
  - Performs full driver restart after 3 consecutive failures
  - Runs at higher priority (6) than other CAN tasks

### 3. **Improved Error Handling**
- Enhanced `receive_frames_task()` with:
  - Timeout handling for `twai_read_alerts()` to prevent blocking
  - Automatic queue clearing when RX queue is full
  - Better error logging with error codes
  - Periodic health monitoring

### 4. **Transmission Monitoring**
- Added `last_successful_tx` timestamp tracking
- Enhanced `send_can_frame()` with error recovery calls
- Improved `send_message()` with detailed error reporting
- Added transmission success tracking

### 5. **Enhanced Initialization**
- Improved `waveshare_twai_init()` with:
  - Better error handling and cleanup on failure
  - Additional alert types (TX_FAILED, TX_SUCCESS)
  - Proper initialization of monitoring variables

## Key Features Added

### Automatic Recovery Mechanisms:
- **Bus-Off Recovery**: Automatically detects and recovers from Bus-Off state
- **Error Counter Monitoring**: Initiates recovery when error counts exceed 100
- **Queue Overflow Handling**: Clears RX queue when it becomes full
- **Full Driver Restart**: Complete driver reinitialization after multiple failures

### Monitoring and Logging:
- **Status Monitoring**: Regular status checks with detailed logging
- **Error Tracking**: Comprehensive error logging with error codes
- **Recovery Counting**: Tracks number of recovery attempts
- **Health Monitoring**: Monitors transmission success over time

### Task Management:
- **Watchdog Task**: Dedicated monitoring task with higher priority
- **Timeout Handling**: Prevents indefinite blocking in alert reading
- **Error Propagation**: Proper error handling throughout the call chain

## Usage

The fixes are automatically active once you compile and flash the updated code. The system will now:

1. **Automatically recover** from CAN bus errors
2. **Monitor health** continuously and log status
3. **Handle failures gracefully** without stopping communication
4. **Provide detailed logging** for debugging

## Monitoring

Watch the logs for these key indicators:
- `CAN Status` messages every 5 seconds
- `CAN Bus-Off detected!` when recovery is triggered
- `CAN driver restarted successfully` when recovery succeeds
- `Too many consecutive CAN failures` when full restart is needed

## Expected Results

With these fixes, your CAN bus communication should:
- **Continue working** even after temporary bus errors
- **Automatically recover** from Bus-Off conditions
- **Provide clear logging** of any issues that occur
- **Maintain stable operation** over extended periods

The system is now much more robust and should handle the intermittent CAN bus issues that were causing communication to stop.
